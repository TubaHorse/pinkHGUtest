# pinkHGUtest
With this mod for Arma 3 I am attempting to turn the default helicopter helmet with the visor to be pink. I have tried so many times but the game will not recognise the .paa that I have set for it to use. I've attempted to follo AstartesGaming's tutorial to no avail.

To make the texture I used https://paa.gruppe-adler.de/ to turn the default arma helmet_heli_blk_co.paa into a .png
I edited the .png in photoshop to doodle on it, saved it as helmet_heli_blk_coo.png
Used the converter to turn it back into a .paa file.
Opened the .paa in TexView 2 to confirm that the edits remain
Binarised the config (not present in this upload), packed the .pbo
Ran the game, opened ACE Arsenal
Game does not load the helmet textures. It shows the visor floating in front of the character's face
