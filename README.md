# pinkHGUtest
With this mod for Arma 3 I am attempting to turn the default helicopter helmet with the visor to be pink. I have tried so many times but the game will not recognise the .paa that I have set for it to use. I've attempted to follo AstartesGaming's tutorial to no avail.

The @pinkHGU folder is the mod with the .pbo packed and config binarised
The pinkHGU Unpacked Files folder has the contents of the pbo unpacked and config.cpp not binarised for ease of editing/looking

Mod now works, texture is just needed
